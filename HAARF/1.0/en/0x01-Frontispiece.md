## About the Standard  

The **Healthcare AI Agents Security Verification Standard (HAARF)** is a community‑driven catalogue of security and safety requirements that healthcare organizations, AI developers, regulatory professionals, clinical teams, security specialists, and auditors can use to design, build, test, and verify **safe, secure, and compliant autonomous AI agents in healthcare environments**.

HAARF provides a common language for specifying security and safety controls across the entire AI agent lifecycle—from initial risk assessment and development through deployment, monitoring, and continuous oversight—enabling healthcare organizations to measure and improve the safety, security, transparency, and regulatory compliance of their AI agent implementations.

## Healthcare-Specific Focus

Unlike general AI security standards, HAARF addresses the unique requirements of healthcare environments:

- **Patient Safety First**: Every requirement prioritizes patient safety and clinical outcome quality
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Direct alignment with FDA, EU AI Act, Health Canada, UK MHRA, and WHO guidelines
- **Clinical Workflow Integration**: Verification requirements for seamless integration with existing healthcare workflows
- **Medical Data Protection**: Specialized requirements for handling PHI/PII in compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, and healthcare privacy regulations
- **Human-Centered Care**: Emphasis on augmenting human healthcare professionals, not replacing them
