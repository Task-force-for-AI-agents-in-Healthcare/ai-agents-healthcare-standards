# HAARF v1.0 Categories Overview

The **Healthcare AI Agents Regulatory Framework (HAARF)** v1.0 defines regulatory compliance and safety requirements across **eight comprehensive categories**, each addressing critical aspects of healthcare AI agent deployment. These categories reflect the unique requirements of healthcare environments, align with global regulatory frameworks, and incorporate insights from the Healthcare AI Agents Working Group meetings with FDA industry committee stakeholders.

**Built upon OWASP AISVS Foundation**: HAARF is adapted from the excellent [OWASP Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Standard (AISVS)](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS) framework, specialized for healthcare regulatory compliance.
