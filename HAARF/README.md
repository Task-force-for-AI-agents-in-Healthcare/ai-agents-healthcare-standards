## Introduction

The **Healthcare AI Agents Regulatory Framework (HAARF)** provides healthcare organizations, AI developers, regulators, and security professionals with a structured compliance framework to evaluate and verify the safety, security, and regulatory compliance of autonomous AI agents in healthcare settings. 

Built on the foundation of OWASP AISVS methodology and aligned with global regulatory frameworks (FDA, EU AI Act, Health Canada, UK MHRA, NIST AI RMF, WHO GI-AI4H), HAARF defines verification requirements across **eight comprehensive categories** developed through collaboration with the FDA industry committee working group:

## Core Verification Categories

1. [**C1: Unified Risk & Lifecycle Assessment**](1.0/en/0x10-C01-Risk-Lifecycle-Assessment.md) - FDA PCCP, EU AI Act compliance, continuous monitoring
2. [**C2: AI Model Passport & Traceability**](1.0/en/0x10-C02-Model-Passport-Traceability.md) - Complete lifecycle documentation, XAI, audit compliance  
3. [**C3: Proactive Cybersecurity Framework**](1.0/en/0x10-C03-Cybersecurity-Framework.md) - AISVS-aligned security, adversarial robustness, threat monitoring
4. [**C4: Human-in-the-Loop Oversight**](1.0/en/0x10-C04-Human-Oversight.md) - Clinical integration, human factors, accountability frameworks
5. [**C5: Agent Registration & Identity Management**](1.0/en/0x10-C05-Agent-Registration-Identity.md) - Agent cataloging, authentication, lifecycle tracking
6. [**C6: Agent Autonomy Levels & Governance**](1.0/en/0x10-C06-Autonomy-Governance.md) - Progressive autonomy, safety boundaries, emergency controls
7. [**C7: Bias Mitigation & Population Equity**](1.0/en/0x10-C07-Bias-Equity-Population.md) - Fairness across populations, vulnerable patient protection
8. [**C8: Tool Use & Integration Security**](1.0/en/0x10-C08-Tool-Use-Integration.md) - Tool-enabled agent regulatory compliance, medical device integration **‚≠ê FDA Priority**

## Healthcare-Specific Focus Areas

HAARF extends traditional AI security verification to address the unique requirements of healthcare environments:

- **Patient Safety & Clinical Workflow Integration** - Verification requirements for clinical decision support and patient care pathways
- **Medical Device Regulatory Compliance** - Alignment with FDA 510(k), EU MDR/IVDR, and international medical device standards
- **Healthcare Data Privacy & Security** - HIPAA, GDPR compliance for medical AI agents processing PHI/PII
- **Clinical Human Factors** - Healthcare-specific usability, bias prevention, and human oversight requirements
- **Medical AI Supply Chain Security** - Verification for healthcare AI model repositories, clinical data pipelines, and medical device integration

## Regulatory Framework Alignment

HAARF verification levels and requirements directly align with:

- **FDA**: Total Product Lifecycle approach with Predetermined Change Control Plans (PCCPs)
- **EU AI Act**: High-risk AI system classification and compliance requirements for medical devices
- **Health Canada**: SGBA+ bias mitigation and machine learning-enabled medical device guidance  
- **UK MHRA**: AI Airlock regulatory sandbox approach and real-world evidence requirements
- **NIST AI RMF**: Four-function governance model (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage)
- **WHO GI-AI4H**: Global health equity and human-centered AI principles

**Please [log issues](https://github.com/Task-force-for-AI-agents-in-Healthcare/ai-agents-healthcare-standards/issues) if you find any verification gaps or implementation challenges. We encourage [pull requests](https://github.com/Task-force-for-AI-agents-in-Healthcare/ai-agents-healthcare-standards/pulls) for additional healthcare-specific requirements.**

## Project Leadership

The HAARF project is led by the **Task Force for AI Agents in Healthcare** with leadership from:

- **Framework Architecture**: Multi-stakeholder working groups across healthcare, regulatory, and AI security domains
- **Clinical Integration**: Healthcare practitioners and patient safety advocates  
- **Regulatory Alignment**: FDA, EU, Health Canada, and UK MHRA regulatory affairs experts
- **Technical Implementation**: AISVS contributors and healthcare AI security specialists

## Version History

- **v1.0 (2025)**: Initial release with eight comprehensive verification categories including FDA priority C8 Tool Use & Integration Security
- **v1.1 (Planned)**: Domain-specific healthcare verification requirements (radiology, pathology, clinical decision support)
- **v2.0 (Planned)**: Integration with emerging healthcare AI technologies and international regulatory updates
