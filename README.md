## 🎯 Executive Summary

The **Task Force for AI Agents in Healthcare** presents the world's first **unified, lifecycle-centric regulatory framework** specifically designed for autonomous AI agents in medical environments. Our framework synthesizes the most effective elements from global regulatory bodies—FDA, EU AI Act, Health Canada, UK MHRA, NIST, and WHO—into a comprehensive standard that addresses the unique risks and opportunities of agentic AI systems.

**Unlike traditional AI/ML models that provide predictions, AI agents take autonomous actions.** This fundamental difference requires a new regulatory paradigm focused on continuous governance, traceability, and human oversight.

## 🤖 Understanding AI Agents in Healthcare

AI agents are **autonomous, goal-directed systems** that:

### Core Characteristics
- **🔄 Autonomous Decision-Making**: Make independent choices within defined parameters
- **🎯 Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Plan and execute sequences of actions to achieve specific objectives  
- **🔌 Active Integration**: Direct interaction with healthcare systems (EHRs, diagnostic tools, medical devices)
- **📈 Adaptive Learning**: Continuous learning and evolution from real-world clinical data
- **🤝 Human-AI Collaboration**: Augment human capabilities while maintaining human oversight

### Critical Distinction
**Traditional AI**: Input → Prediction → Human Decision  
**AI Agents**: Input → Autonomous Planning → Direct Action → Continuous Learning

## 🏛️ The Unified Framework: Seven Comprehensive Categories

Based on comprehensive analysis of global regulatory approaches and insights from our Healthcare AI Agents Working Group meetings with FDA industry committee stakeholders, our framework establishes **seven comprehensive verification categories** for AI agent governance in healthcare:

### 🔐 **Standard 1: Unified Risk & Lifecycle Assessment**
**Hybrid EU-FDA Model for Continuous Governance**

- **High-Risk Classification**: All clinical AI agents automatically classified as "High-Risk" under EU AI Act framework
- **Mandatory PCCP**: FDA-style Predetermined Change Control Plans required for all agents
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time surveillance for model drift and performance degradation
- **Regulatory Sandboxes**: UK MHRA-style testing environments for real-world evidence generation

### 📋 **Standard 2: Mandatory AI Model Passport**
**Complete Lifecycle Traceability & Accountability**

- **Data Lineage**: Full provenance tracking with Health Canada SGBA+ diversity analysis
- **Model Lineage**: Comprehensive documentation of algorithms, training, and updates
- **Decision Lineage**: Explainable AI audit trails for every agent output
- **Machine-Interpretable**: Automated compliance verification and regulatory reporting

### 🛡️ **Standard 3: Proactive Cybersecurity Framework**

### 👤 **Standard 4: Human-in-the-Loop Principle**
**Augmentation, Not Replacement**

- **Clear Accountability**: Defined human responsibility chains throughout agent lifecycle
- **Clinical Oversight**: Human validation required for all critical healthcare decisions
- **Human Factors Engineering**: Mandatory usability testing to prevent automation bias
- **Transparency Requirements**: Agent capabilities and limitations clearly communicated to users

### 🆔 **Category 5: Agent Registration & Identity Management**
**Comprehensive Agent Visibility & Control**

- **Healthcare Agent Cataloging**: Centralized registries for all AI agents in clinical environments
- **Identity Verification**: Cryptographic authentication and healthcare IAM integration
- **Lifecycle Management**: Complete tracking from deployment to decommissioning
