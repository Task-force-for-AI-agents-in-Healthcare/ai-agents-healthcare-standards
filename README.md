## 🎯 What is HAAISVS?

The **Task Force for AI Agents in Healthcare** presents the world's first **unified, lifecycle-centric regulatory framework** specifically designed for autonomous AI agents in medical environments. Our framework synthesizes the most effective elements from global regulatory bodies—FDA, EU AI Act, Health Canada, UK MHRA, NIST, and WHO—into a comprehensive standard that addresses the unique risks and opportunities of agentic AI systems.

**Unlike traditional AI/ML models that provide predictions, AI agents take autonomous actions.** This fundamental difference requires a new regulatory paradigm focused on continuous governance, traceability, and human oversight.

## 🤖 Understanding AI Agents in Healthcare

AI agents are **autonomous, goal-directed systems** that:

### Core Characteristics
- **🔄 Autonomous Decision-Making**: Make independent choices within defined parameters
- **🎯 Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Plan and execute sequences of actions to achieve specific objectives  
- **🔌 Active Integration**: Direct interaction with healthcare systems (EHRs, diagnostic tools, medical devices)
- **📈 Adaptive Learning**: Continuous learning and evolution from real-world clinical data
- **🤝 Human-AI Collaboration**: Augment human capabilities while maintaining human oversight

### Critical Distinction
**Traditional AI**: Input → Prediction → Human Decision  
**AI Agents**: Input → Autonomous Planning → Direct Action → Continuous Learning

## 🏛️ Eight Core Verification Categories

Based on comprehensive analysis of global regulatory approaches and insights from our Healthcare AI Agents Working Group meetings with FDA industry committee stakeholders, our framework establishes **eight comprehensive verification categories** for AI agent governance in healthcare, with recent FDA priority enhancements addressing tool-enabled agent regulatory pathways:
