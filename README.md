## 🎯 Mission

The Task Force for AI Agents in Healthcare is creating the first comprehensive regulatory framework specifically designed for autonomous AI agents in medical environments. Our standards enable healthcare organizations to deploy AI agents safely while providing clear pathways for FDA compliance.

## 🤖 What are AI Agents in Healthcare?

AI agents are autonomous systems that:
- **Access medical tools and APIs** (EHR systems, diagnostic tools, medical devices)
- **Make autonomous decisions** within defined parameters
- **Maintain human-in-the-loop oversight** for critical decisions
- **Interact with healthcare workflows** and clinical processes
- **Adapt and learn** from real-world healthcare environments

*Unlike traditional AI models that provide predictions, AI agents take actions.*

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- [x] AI Agent definition and classification framework
- [x] Initial risk assessment methodology
- [x] Core compliance requirements identification
- [x] Community governance structure
- [x] Stakeholder engagement with 40+ professionals

### 🔄 In Progress (v1.0)
- [ ] **Standards Documentation** - Core framework specification
- [ ] **FDA Compliance Pathways** - Step-by-step regulatory guidance
- [ ] **Risk Management Protocols** - Comprehensive safety frameworks
- [ ] **Artifact Lifecycle Traceability** - Data and model tracking standards
- [ ] **External Audit Process** - SOC 2-style certification framework
- [ ] **Implementation Guidelines** - Practical deployment guidance

### 📋 Planned (v2.0+)
