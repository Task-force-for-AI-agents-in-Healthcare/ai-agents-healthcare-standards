# C5 Agent Registration & Identity Management

## Control Objective

Healthcare AI agents must be uniquely identifiable, registered, and tracked across healthcare networks to enable proper governance, security monitoring, and accountability. This ensures that healthcare organizations maintain complete visibility of AI agents operating in their environments and can establish proper access controls, audit trails, and incident response capabilities for autonomous systems.
