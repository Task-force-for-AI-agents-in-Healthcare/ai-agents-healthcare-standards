# C6 Agent Autonomy Levels & Governance

## Control Objective

Healthcare AI agents must operate within clearly defined autonomy levels with appropriate governance frameworks that ensure safe progression from co-pilot assistance to autonomous action. This addresses the "autonomy and oversight gradient" ensuring that as agents gain more autonomous capabilities, corresponding safety measures, oversight mechanisms, and governance structures scale proportionally to maintain patient safety and clinical accountability.
