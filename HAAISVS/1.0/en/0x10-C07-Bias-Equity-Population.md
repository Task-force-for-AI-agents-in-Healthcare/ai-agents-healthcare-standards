# C7 Bias Mitigation & Population Equity

## Control Objective

Healthcare AI agents must demonstrate fairness, prevent discriminatory outcomes, and ensure equitable performance across diverse patient populations including women, minorities, underrepresented groups, pediatric, elderly, and vulnerable populations. This addresses the critical concern that AI agents trained on non-representative data may perpetuate or amplify existing healthcare disparities, ensuring that AI-augmented care improves outcomes for all patients rather than disadvantaging vulnerable populations.
